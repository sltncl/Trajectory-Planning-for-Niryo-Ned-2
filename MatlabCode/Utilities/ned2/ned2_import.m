    % This function can import robots that have .stl files associated with the
    % Unified Robot Description format (URDF) file to describe the visual
    % geometries of the robot. Each rigid body has an individual visual
    % geometry specified. The importrobot function parses the URDF file to get
    % the robot model and visual geometries.
    % The manipulator's structure would be affected if you edit the file
    % 'new_ned2.sdf', so avoid doing so.
